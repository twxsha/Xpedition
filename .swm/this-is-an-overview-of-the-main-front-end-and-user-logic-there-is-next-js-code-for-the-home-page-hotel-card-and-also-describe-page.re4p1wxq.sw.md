# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the new feature that enhances the user experience on our hotel booking platform. The feature introduces a more intuitive and interactive interface for users to browse and book hotels.

We will cover:

1. How we implemented the Home Page with Next.js.


1. The design and functionality of the Hotel Card component.


1. The creation of the Hotel Description Page.

# Home Page Implementation

The Home Page is the first point of contact for users on our platform. It's crucial that it's not only visually appealing but also functional and easy to navigate. We used Next.js, a popular React framework, for its server-side rendering capabilities, which improves the performance and SEO of our platform.

In the Home Page implementation, we fetch data from our backend API to display a list of hotels. We then map through this data to create a Hotel Card component for each hotel. This is done asynchronously to ensure that the page loads quickly and smoothly.

# Hotel Card Component

Each Hotel Card component represents a single hotel. It displays key information about the hotel, such as its name, location, price, and a thumbnail image. This allows users to quickly browse through hotels and compare them at a glance.

The Hotel Card component also includes a 'Book Now' button. When clicked, it redirects the user to the Hotel Description Page for that specific hotel. This is achieved by passing the hotel's unique ID as a parameter in the URL.

# Hotel Description Page

The Hotel Description Page provides detailed information about a specific hotel. It's accessed by clicking the 'Book Now' button on a Hotel Card component.

On this page, we fetch data for the specific hotel using the unique ID passed in the URL. This data includes detailed information such as the hotel's full description, amenities, room options, and customer reviews.

We also implemented a booking form on this page. Users can select their check-in and check-out dates, choose a room type, and proceed to book the hotel. This form is validated to ensure that all fields are filled in correctly before the booking is processed.
